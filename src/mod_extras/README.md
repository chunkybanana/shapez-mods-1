### {{name}} does it all!

<hr>

-   **API**: Use common functions and focus on content.
-   **Validation**: Metadata is validated, to avoid unexpected errors.
-   **Dependencies**: Checks for installed dependencies and allows requesting
    a specific version.
-   **Changelogs**: Get some clues about new features when updating mods.
-   **Search**: Having many mods is not a problem anymore.

_Some features may be missing or incomplete, this mod is still in development._

### Reworked mod list

If you're reading this section, most likely you have installed this mod. {{name}}
brings a completely new mod list, rewritten from scratch! Start typing and filter
your sorted mod collection.

Outdated mods or mods with missing dependencies will be brought up to attract
your attention, while broken mods will be shown last. Toggle visibility of library
mods, if you only care about the gameplay. Follow changes of your favorite mods
and contact their authors, open website or view the source code!

### Still not enough?

More is planned â€“ {{name}} continues to add more quality-of-life features to make mod management
easier.
